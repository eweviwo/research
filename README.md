### Research 

This repo will guide the project and community's effort to reasearch for content development only. This is the simplest repo of the project according to files you will have to interact with. It involves a txt document as a base file for all contribution. 

We know with varied intellectual contributions, there comes about a lot of technical arguement. The project has a lot of ongoing knoweldge seeking and we encourage everyone to recognise the dependencies involved and have some patience towards a 'quick' understanding. We are starting all audience from a zero understanding.

You don't need to understand how an application or the internet works to be able to contribute to this file. However, the technologists in the community are observing how the file develops in other to make it a better component of the BAG. Any suggestions to improve the contribution format can be done by putting in an issue or a pull request. 

Continuously check with its latest state before raising an issue or PR.
