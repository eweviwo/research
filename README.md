### Research 

This repo will guide the project's effort to come out with some research to support our content development. It involves a text document as a base file for all contribution input. 

With varied intellectual opinions comes about different viewpoints. We encourage contributors to tolerate viewpoints and communicate theirs clearly, briefly and share resources as much as possible when making a pull request. The information and knowledge development for the project has a lot of dependencies involved and we encourage everyone to have some patience towards a 'quick' understanding. We are starting all audience from a zero understanding.

You don't need to understand the tech approach of the project to be able to contribute to this file. However, the tech developers in the community are observing how the file develops in other to make it a better component of the BAG in the future.
